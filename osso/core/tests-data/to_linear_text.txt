Normal paragraph. This should end with dual LF because of the next P.

The 2nd P with a couple of BRs in it:
<- here, and
<- here.
This next line here has no extra preceding LF because it's no P.
This is a continuation of the previous line. Only one LF precedes it.

A nice little block-level element once again. (Double LF before because of the explicit BR.)
