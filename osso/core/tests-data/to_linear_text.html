<BODY>
  <p>Normal <b>paragraph</b>. This <i>should</i> end with <b>dual LF</b> because of the next P.</p>

  <p></p><p><!-- some markup p's that we won't show --></p>

  <p>The 2nd P with a couple of BRs in it:<br>&lt;- here, and <br>&lt;- here.</p>
  <em>This next line here has no extra preceding LF because it's no P.</em><br>

  This is a continuation of the
  previous line. Only one LF
  precedes it.<br/>

  <ADDRESS>A nice little block-level element once again.
  (Double LF before because of the explicit BR.)</ADDRESS>
